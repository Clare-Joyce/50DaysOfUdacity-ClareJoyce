# Day 17!!!

* Started by revising the concept of feature learning.
* Feature learning in supervised and unsupervised learning.
* Applications of feature learning
  * Image classification
  * Image search
  * feature embedding
* Image classification with CNNs
* The two types is hidden layers in a CNN, how they operate and the importance of each.
* Image search with an autoencoder
* An overview of the structure of an autoencoder and how it works.
* The middle layer of the autoencoder being responsible for the production of the feature vector.
* And a feature vector being a compressed(reduction in dimension) representation of the input.
* Anomaly detection
  * supervised: basically a classification problem
  * unsupervised: basically a clustering problem
* One major characteristics of anomaly detection problems **Imbalance data**
* Different applications of anomaly detection
* Anomaly detection in machinery maintenance
* Forecasting and the different forecasting algorithms.
* Lab: **AML used in managing the life time of vehicles and how it helps in the creation of better maintenance plans.
* Completed lesson 5!!!
