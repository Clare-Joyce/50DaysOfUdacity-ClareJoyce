# Day 30
**Intro to Machine Learning.**
* Successfully completed project 1: Classifying emails between two authors.
* Had to do a lot of work on the starter code because the starter code is a python 2:slightly_frowning_face: script and I am using python 3.
* A lot of deprecated :face_with_raised_eyebrow:modules used in the starter code, hence lot of changes.
* Successfully completed the project and learned:blush: a lot navigating the trace-back errors and fixing them.
