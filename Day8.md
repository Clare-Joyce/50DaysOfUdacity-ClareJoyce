# Day 8!!!

**Yes, I started lesson 3 today: Model Training.:tada:**

* Data preparation being the very first step in model training, I studied  some steps involved in data preparation.
* Data import and transformation.
* Learned about the interactive process of cleaning, restructuring and enriching data, basically the process of transforming data into a form that is suitable for analysis (Data Wrangling). This process is very important in the model training process because ML algorithms are highly sensitive to data quality.
* Completed lab 2:100:, data import and transformation on Azure:blush:, combining data from different sources, cleaning the data and registering it:fire:
* Learned about Azure data management tools (Datastores and Datasets) and how they are used in the ML process on Azure.
* Studied the steps involved in the data access workflow.
  * Create a datastore
  * Create a dataset
  * Create a dataset monitor(to detect issues in dataset such as datadrift)
* The two dataset types supported in Azure (Tabular and Web URL)
* Data versioning is and its importance.
* Completed lab 3:mario_luigi_dance:, registering datasets and creating different versions of the dataset.

Day 8 and I feel great:joy: #50daysofudacity.
