# Day 7.

Yes! :dancer:Completed Lesson 2: Introduction to Machine Learning.:100:
* Learning Functions
  * ML algorithms aim at learning a function that describes the mapping between input X and output Y
  * The difference between the model error and the irreducible error.
* The two categories of ML algorithms based on the shape and structure of the function being learned.
  * Parametric: known functional forms are assumed for the mapping between input and output.
  * Non-parametric: No assumptions about the form of the mapping between input and output is made.
  * The benefits and limitations of these two categories of ML algorithms.
* The relation between classical ML and Deep Learning.
* Approaches to ML: Supervised,  Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning.
* The trade-offs:
  * Bias vs Variance
  * Over-fitting vs Under-fitting

Glad I have completed lesson 2. Ready to start off with lesson 3 tomorrow:fire:. **#50daysofudacity**

Only heaven knows which lesson I would have been struggling to finish if I didn't pledge for this challenge.
