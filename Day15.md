Day 15!:dancer:
* Started with learning what Deep Learning(DL) is 
* Studied the characteristics of DL.
* Then the benefits and applications of DL.
* Trained and evaluated the performance of a simple neural net(predicting NYC taxi fares.
* A revision of the main approaches model training supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning
* A revision of the main classes of problems regression, classification, clustering
* Then an overview of the special cases Similarity learning, text classification, feature learning, Anomaly detection, forecasting
* Similarity learning as a supervised learning problem(as a regression problem and as a classification problem).
* Recommender systems as a typical application of similarity learning.
* The two approaches to recommender systems content based and collaborative filtering
* Trained a simple movie recommender engine with the SVD module. This model predicts the rating a user will give to a movie and then recommends or not.
