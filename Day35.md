# Day 35!!!
** Into to Machine Learning**
* Decision Tree Parameters.
  * **min-sample-split:** How it controls the splitting depth
* Data impurity and Entropy:
  * **Entropy:** Controls how a Decision Tree(DT) decides where to split the data
  * It is the measure of impurity in a bunch of examples
  * How to calculate entropy
* Information Gain:
  * parent entropy
  * weighted entropy for the children(depending on what future used to split the data)
  * how IG is used to determine where to start splitting the data
* Tuning the criterion parameter
* Bias vs Variance Dilemma
* DT strengths and weaknesses
* Email classification project.
